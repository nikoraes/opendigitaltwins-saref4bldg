# Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) ontology for Smart Buildings based on SAREF

The original SAREF extension for building ontology is represented using the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) and it can be visualized [here](https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/v1.1.2/). It has been converted into the DTDL syntax used in this repository using the universal [OWL2DTDL](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building-tools/tree/master/OWL2DTDL) tool.
